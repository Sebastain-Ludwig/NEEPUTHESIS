With the rapid development of the power and electron parts, PWM voltage inverter is applied, on a larger and larger scale, to ac frequency control system、UPS、power quality controller and Converter of highlight HVDC transmission. Non-ripple DC voltage source of PWM voltage type Inverter is gained by rectifiers paralleled connection a large DC filter capacitor. The equipment that uses a large DC filter capacitor has disadvantages, such as bulk, high price and low power quality. It is therefore becoming most significant and valuable to do research on how to reduce capacitance as small as possible or even remove capacitor and how to settle relative issues and to eliminate low order harmonics due to minishing capacitance or removing capacitor. Based on the survey of main circuits of inverter and restraining harmonic effects of PWM techniques, the main circuits and harmonic elimination PWM techniques of SPWM voltage type inverter, which applied widely in industry fields, are profoundly analyzed.\par
